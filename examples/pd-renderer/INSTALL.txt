This pd-renderer example depends on three items:

1. Pd-extended   To download, go to: http://puredata.info/community/projects/software/pd-extended

2. the pd external: "spatosc"   (located in the "pd-external" subdirectory of the  spatosc/examples). Follow instructions to make and install;

3. The pdsheefa library (externs, abstractions)

To download and install, follow instructions on the site  http://code.sat.qc.ca/trac/pdsheefa.



Note: you must make sure that you add the paths to "pdsheefa" and "spatosc" in pd-extended's search paths (either by via the command line, or in the preferences).   See instructions in spatosc/examples/pd-external, and on the pdsheefa site.

For example on OSX,  you would launch pd-extended, and select "File->Preferences->Path..."

~/Library/Pd/spatosc
~/Library/Pd/pdsheefa


Now the items in this example can be run by double clicking on them.
