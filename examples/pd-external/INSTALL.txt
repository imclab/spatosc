This extern depends on the spatosc library, which must be compiled and installed before making  (see README in spatosc directory).

Once the spatosc library has been compiled and installed, do:

> make
> make install


This extern will be installed to:

for OSX: 
	~/Library/Pd/spatosc
	
for Linux:
	/usr/local/lib/pd-externals/spatosc

note: you will need to add the above directory to your pd (pd-extended) search path, according to your OS, or specify the path on the command line, e.g:  "pd-extended -path   /usr/local/lib/pd-externals/spatosc "
