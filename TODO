Spatosc TODO
============

Implementations
---------------
 * Implement SpatdifReceiver
 * Implement SpatdifTranslator

OSC
---
 * support lo_send_from in OscSender

Examples
--------
 * Progress in the Ogre example
 * Make the clutter / openal example use meters in its GUI
 * Update the openal rendering example

Packaging
---------
 * add an --enable-debug flag
 * remove non-public functions and typedefs from include/*.h

Refactoring
-----------
 * remove friend classes in vBaseNode
 * Cleanup the public interface of the public classes.
 * Scene::update methods should be renamed to something more meaningful
 * convert aed-style orientation into quaternions. (or at least support also quaternions)
 * rename dmitri_translator.h like that.
 * rename Node.setPosition to setPositionXYZ(x,y,z)
 * add setPositionAED(a, e, d)
 * split Scene::getOrCreate* methods into get* and create*
 * remove Scene::getConnection (const std::string &id) (there is already getConnection(src_id, snk_id))
 * remove Scene::connect (src_id, sink_id), the Node* version is faster.
 * Scene::disconnect should be disconnect(Node*, Node*), (not disconnect(string conn_id))

Error handling
--------------
 * Node id need to be unique. (either Listener or Sources)
