Spatosc TODO
============

Features
---------------
 * Load balancing, don't push all the state, all the time, over OSC. Only push whatever's changed, and at some controlled rate.
 * Support world coordinates changes. (for example, in the dome, +X is on your right, but +Z behind you and +Y is up)
 * Support multicast and TCP in OscSender and OscReceiver. Perhaps use liblo urls in constructor arguments? (eg, osc.upd://239.0.0.1:9999/ or osc.tcp://localhost:9998/)

Examples
--------
 * Progress in the Ogre example
 * Make the clutter / openal example use meters in its GUI
 * Update the openal rendering example

Packaging
---------
 * remove non-public functions and typedefs from include/*.h
 * maths:425 and 450: conversion from 'double' to 'float', possible loss of data
 * regex support on OSX has broken; need to fix

Refactoring
-----------
 * remove friend classes in Node
 * Cleanup the public interface of the public classes.
 * convert aed-style orientation into quaternions. (or at least support also quaternions)
 * Should we warn clients that we disconnected some nodes?
 * Add property map to translators

Error handling
--------------

Wrapper for OSC and FUDI callbacks
----------------------------------
 * [s:nodeName] [s:method] [s:typeTags] [s:args...]
