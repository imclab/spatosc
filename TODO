Spatosc TODO
============

Features
---------------
 * Fix flushMessages
 * Load balancing, don't push all the state, all the time, over OSC. Only push whatever's changed, and at some controlled rate.
 * Support multicast and TCP in OscSender and OscReceiver. Perhaps use liblo urls in constructor arguments? (eg, osc.upd://239.0.0.1:9999/ or osc.tcp://localhost:9998/)
 * Support specifying the network interface to listen from
 * Each node has a map<string,string> of attributes and they're pushed when updated
 * Implement Translator::getSender to allow sending custom messages (already implemented in dmitriTranslator. should return NULL in base class)
 * support either int, float, double for numerical OSC typetags. ie, in oscutil, change argMatchesType() to something like getStringArg() and getNumericArg() using these liblo methods:
   * int lo_is_numerical_type(lo_type a)
   * int lo_is_string_type(lo_type a)
   * lo_hires lo_hires_val(lo_type type, lo_arg * p)

Examples
--------
 * Progress in the Ogre example

Packaging
---------
 * remove non-public functions and typedefs from include/*.h
 * maths:425 and 450: conversion from 'double' to 'float', possible loss of data
 * regex support on OSX has broken; need to fix

Refactoring
-----------
 * Scene with receiver should be subclass of regular scene. We shouldn't have to do if (receiver_) all the time.
 * Cleanup the public interface of the public classes.
 * convert aed-style orientation into quaternions. (or at least support also quaternions)
 * Should we warn clients that we disconnected some nodes?
 * Add property map to translators
 * Rename SoundSource to Source and Listener to Sink.

Error handling
--------------

Wrapper for OSC and FUDI callbacks
----------------------------------
 * [s:nodeName] [s:method] [s:typeTags] [s:args...]
