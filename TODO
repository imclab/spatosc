Spatosc TODO
============

Implementations
---------------
 * Implement SpatdifReceiver
 * Implement SpatdifTranslator

OSC
---
 * support lo_send_from in OscSender

Examples
--------
 * Progress in the Ogre example
 * Make the clutter / openal example use meters in its GUI
 * Update the openal rendering example

Packaging
---------
 * add an --enable-debug flag
 * remove non-public functions and typedefs from include/*.h
 * build and install on Windows (needs <tr1/memory>, <regex.h> and <sys/utsname.h>)
 * maths:425 and 450: conversion from 'double' to 'float', possible loss of data

Refactoring
-----------
 * remove friend classes in vBaseNode
 * Cleanup the public interface of the public classes.
 * Scene::update methods should be renamed to something more meaningful
 * convert aed-style orientation into quaternions. (or at least support also quaternions)
 * rename dmitri_translator.h like that.
 * rename Node.setPosition to setPositionXYZ(x,y,z)
 * add setPositionAED(a, e, d)
 * Should we warn clients that we disconnected some nodes?

Error handling
--------------
 * We should also check the type of the two nodes in connect(). We should implement bool Node::isSource() and bool Node::isSink()

Wrapper for OSC and FUDI callbacks
----------------------------------
 * [s:nodeName] [s:method] [s:typeTags] [s:args...]
