------------

 * refactor the API (remove v prefix, maybe change camel case methods for boost-style (underscores))
 * enclose everything in the spatosc namespace
 * remove non-public functions and typedefs from include/*.h
 * remove friend classes in vBaseNode
 * find from where vMath.h comes from. Maybe refactor it?
 * data member should have a trailing underscore in their name
 * use SPATOSC_API_VERSION in spatosc.pc.in and src/Makefile.am
 * move the example to examples/
