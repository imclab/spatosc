Spatosc TODO
------------

 * decide on a coding style
 * choose a namespace
 * refactor the API (remove v prefix, maybe change camel case methods for boost-style (underscores))
 * enclose everything in the spatosc namespace
 * create a stable 0.2 branch
 * remove non-public functions and typedefs from include/*.h
 * document the API (doxygen-style)
 * package the doxygen doc generation
 * remove friend classes in vBaseNode
 * use cmath, not math.h (?)
 * find from where vMath.h comes from. Maybe refactor it?
 * should data member have a trailing underscore in their name?
