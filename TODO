Refactoring
-----------
 * remove friend classes in vBaseNode
 * Cleanup the public interface of the public classes.
 * can we split Scene::getOrCreate methods into get and create?
 * can we raise exception if a given node is not found? (instead of returning a null pointer)
 * can we remove the Scene::getNode method? (there are already getListener and getSoundSource)
 * Can we remove Scene::getConnection (const std::string &id) ?
 * Can we remove connect (Node *src, Node *snk) ?
 * disconnect should be disconnect (const std::string &src, const std::string &snk)
 * Scene::update methods should be renamed to something more meaningful
 * convert aed-style orientation into quaternions. (or at least support also quaternions)
